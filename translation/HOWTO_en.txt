=======================================
  Translation method
=======================================

This section describes the procedure
for creating a translation file for English as an example.


<1> Copy the translation source text file,
    for the language you want to translate
--------------------------------------------------------

$ cp ja en_US

- File name, please in the language name of two characters or five characters.

- If the language name of the system to match the name of the five characters
  is the file is read into the priority,
  if there is nothing that matches the name of five characters,
  it is loaded If there is a match with the name of the first two characters will.

- If the language of the system was en_US,
  first to look for a en_US.mtr, if not found, look for the en.mtr.
  It is the case there was no, embedded in the soft default string (English) is used.


<2> Edit the copied text file
---------------------------------------

[Example]
ja:    3=はい
en_US: 3=Yes


<3> Compile a tool to convert from text to binary data
---------------------------------------------------------

Compile the mtrconv.c, it produces an executable file.

When you run the following command in a mtrconv.c directory,
you can easily create by using the Makefile.

$ make


<4> Using tools, generate the binary data
------------------------------------------

$ ./mtrconv en_US en_US.mtr

The text file name of the conversion source to the first argument,
Specify the file name of the binary data to be output to the second argument.


<5> Confirmation
-----------------------

Actually running, make sure that it can be translated.

$ azpainter --trfile en_US.mtr

With --trfile option,
it can be loaded by specifying the translation file directly.


<6> Copy the mtr file, the installation directory of application
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to read the optimal translation file automatically,
from the language of the system,
you need to put the mtr file to the application data directory for.

Location of put the translation file directory,
if you compile from the source file,
the default in the '/usr/local/share/azpainter/tr'.
If you installed in a different location,
grass die and copy it to that location.

# cp en_US.mtr /usr/local/share/azpainter/tr

Now, because of the system of the language file is opened in default
at the time of start-up, if the system is en_US en_US.mtr is loaded.
